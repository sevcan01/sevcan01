### Hi there 👋


**sevcan01/sevcan01`README.md`😶‍🌫️

I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a 6-month course, and I am having a lot of fun creating new projects. As someone who is new to web development, I am excited about the endless possibilities that come with mastering these skills. :star_struck:

Throughout this course, I have been challenged to create various projects, including websites and interactive web applications. Each project has allowed me to apply my newfound knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in unique and creative ways. :100:
